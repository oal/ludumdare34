# Crazy Slinky Snake

Crazy Slinky Snake is my entry for the LudumDare 34 game jam, and was made in 48 hours.

You control a snake, whose only goal is to eat as many plants as possible before dying an inevitable death.

The snake starts out slow and maneuverable, but the longer it gets, the faster it moves,
and the harder it gets to actually hit the plants.

## How it was made

The game runs in the browser using WebGL, thanks to Three.js. It was programmed in ES2015 (ES6) and
transpiled by Babel.js, and packaged by Webpack.

The plant and snake body were made using Blender, and the intro screen background was made with Affinity Photo.

## Licensing and making changes

I don't want to put a license on this. Feel free to explore the code and make changes for your own educational
purposes. Just don't use this as a base for your own games. Everything was made in two days, so I've taken
plenty of shortcuts and commented the code very sparsely to save time.
